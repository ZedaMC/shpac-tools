# Shpac Tools
Using this project you can easily verify,encrypt and decrypt shpac files. When decrypting a shpac file you also have an option to decompile and uncompress everything. Works with Nintendo Alarmo.

Usage: python main.py verify/encrypt/decrypt/decrypt_and_decompile infile outfile

# Setting up
1. Clone the repository
2. Download unluac (https://sourceforge.net/projects/unluac/files/Unstable/)
3. Rename the jar to unluac.jar and put in in the tools folder
4. In key.py enter your Alarmo's AES_KEY and AES_IV.
